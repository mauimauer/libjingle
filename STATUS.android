   Ok, i've able to build it, and callapp started, but real p2ptransport
   not works due to: following error:
   Warning(basicportallocator.cc:408): Machine has no networks; no ports will be allocated
   Seems like i've missed somthing, unittests should help
   NOTE: If libjingle built as dynamic lib call app crash with SIGSEGV, so let's
   use static one for awhile, investigate it later.
** DONE Add unittests builds

   W/o this stage it is useless to start any other works.
   - base_unittest works fine, but crushed due to bug in gtest-1.6 itself
   - p2p_unittest output similar to linux one.
   It is appeader that callapp not works due to luck of ifaddrs header in android
   talk/base/network.cc:185: BasicNetworkManager::CreateNetworks

** NEXT Make external git repo
** TODO Investigate conwinient way to import linux device headers for android
   'ifaddrs.h' headers required to build network device/address lookup support
   Off cource it is trivial to copy it from somewhere,
   https://raw.github.com/CyanogenMod/android_libcore/gingerbread/luni/src/main/native/ifaddrs-android.h
   but it is better to find out right way to import system/kernel headers.
   
** TODO Implement mediaengine via mediastreamer2 similar linphone-android
